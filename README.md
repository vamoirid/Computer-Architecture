# Computer-Architecture
This repository contains all the assignments for the Academic Courses "Advanced Computer Architecture" taught in the Fall of 2019-2020 in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The purpose of this laboratory series is first of all the familiarity with **gem5**, which is a computer system simulation platform. Secondly, it is the deeper understanding of how **gem5** really works and how to modify the CPU Cache parameters in order to increase the Performance and the CPI of a processor with respect to the cost of these changes. Finally, **gem5** results are combined with the **McPAT** which is an integrated Power, Area and Timing modeling framework for Multicore and Manycore architectures from HP-Labs in order to see how each change affects the physical size and the enrgy consumed by the Processor.

The results of every assignment are listed in the respective folders and are provided in the respective README.md files.
