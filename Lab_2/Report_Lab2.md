###1. Cache Memory parameters in generated files.

Every generated file from the simulation contains all the preconfigured parameters of the system and obviously the results of the simulation. In this assignement we need to find some general characteristics about Cache Memories inside the CPU and comment on them. The specific parameters that we need to look for are:

* L1 Instruction Cache size
* L1 Instruction Cache Associativity
* L1 Data Cache size
* L1 Data Cache Associativity
* L2 Cache size
* L2 Cache Associativity
* Cache Line size

What we need to do, is to search for the respective references of each parameter in order to find its value. For the sake of readability and organization we are going to search the _config.ini_ file of a simulation.
